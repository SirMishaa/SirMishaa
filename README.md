Hi, I'm Mishaa, a full stack developer passionate about science, music, astronomy and technology. My current dream is to move to Canada and to be able to make a living from my passion which is software development and engineering. I'm also a big cat fan, but that's another story...

I am someone who loves a challenge and is in perpetual search of knowledge.

### What I'm focusing on ðŸ‘€

I am currently improving my knowledge of [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [DDD](https://www.amazon.com.be/Domain-Driven-Design-Distilled-Vernon-Vaughn/dp/0134434420).

Otherwise, I use Rust. Rust is good. Do Rust. ðŸ¦€
