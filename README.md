Hi, I'm Mishaa, a full stack developer passionate about science, music, astronomy and technology. My current dream is to move to Canada and to be able to make a living from my passion which is software development and engineering. I'm also a big cat fan, but that's another story...

I am someone who loves a challenge and is in perpetual search of knowledge.

I am currently improving my knowledge of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) especially with the in-depth learning of the new [composition API](https://composition-api.vuejs.org/) of Vue 3.
I'm also very interested by [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and [AdonisJS](https://adonisjs.com/) which are great backend frameworks.

I'm a big fan of the devops and modern approach which I find really improves the quality of software but it still requires learning a lot of tools like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for example. These are two tools that I use for all my projects.

### Find me elsewhere ‚úâ
You can contact me through my [email address](mailto:mishapro@mm.st?subject=Hello%2C%20I've%20seen%20your%20Github%20profile%20!) or from my [website](https://mishaa.dev) (work in progress üòÅ).
